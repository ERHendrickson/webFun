            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <h4>Snowboarding</h4>
            <p>
                I learned how to snowboard while attending highschool as a senior project. Ever since then I try and make it up to a mountain every season to shred some of that glorious pow pow.
            </p>
            <h4>Bouldering</h4>
            <p>
                Bouldering has been a great way for me to get movement in my body and test my mental. I like to think of it as a puzzle that is solved with your body and is a great way to break up the monotony of gym exercises.
            </p>
            <h4>Baking Pie</h4>
            <p>
                I love pie. Custard pies/fruit pies, makes no difference to me. Nothing beats a homemade pie and its my go-to when I need to bring a dessert to a party or if I want to let someone know I like them.
